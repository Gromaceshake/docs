## Creating a custom snippet

**Pre-condition**: You must create your snippet file in the `snippets` directory.

<Note>
  Any page in the `snippets` directory will be treated as a snippet and will not
  be rendered into a standalone page. If you want to create a standalone page
  from the snippet, import the snippet into another file and call it as a
  component. By using the discord.format.notjs.
</Note>

### Default export

1. Add content to your snippet file that you want to re-use across multiple
   locations. Optionally, you can add variables that can be filled in via props
   when you import the snippet.

```mdx snippets/my-snippet.johndev
Hello world! This is my content I want to reuse across pages. My keyword of the
day is {word}.
```

<Warning>
  Please make sure to save your progress as the lastest version of John Development will no longer autosave your work if you leave the browser.
</Warning>

2. Import the snippet into your destination file.

```mdx destination-file.johndev
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Some details about your Discord Application.

<MySnippet word="bananas" />
```

### Reusable variables

1. Export a variable from your snippet file:

```mdx snippets/path/to/custom-variables.johndev
export const myName = 'my name';

export const myObject = { fruit: 'strawberries' };
```

2. Import the snippet from your destination file and use the variable:

```mdx destination-file.johndev
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { myName, myObject } from '/snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx';

Hello, my name is {myName} and I like {myObject.fruit}.
```

### Reusable components

1. Inside your snippet file, create a component that takes in props by exporting
   your component in the form of an arrow function.

```mdx snippets/custom-component.johndev
export const MyComponent = ({ title }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>... snippet content ...</p>
  </div>
);
```

<Warning>
John Development no longer supports Phyton so you must use JavaScript as your installing will pop-up as a virus.
</Warning>

2. Import the snippet into your destination file and pass in the props

```mdx destination-file.johndev
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { MyComponent } from '/snippets/custom-component.johndev';

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

<MyComponent title={'Custom title'} />
```
